# ECB-press-conference-web-crawlers

Nowadays, sentiment is one of the biggest or newest pathways in financial statistics, especially for modelling returns and volatilities. This repository provides a tool to automatically download all European Commercial Bank (ECB) Press Conference transcripts from 1998 until present. These documents are downloaded directly from the official web site of ECB, https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/index.en.html

Because all documents are scraped in the webpage, they are originally of the .HTML form, and of .TXT form after downloading.
Notice that, these documents are really crude and raw, therefore, some further analysis is needed to extract information from these files, and sentiment analysis from this dataset is still a long way to go.

Have fun with it!!!
